# Cursor Agent Files for go-qtools

This directory contains Cursor-specific agent files (rules, plans, etc.) for the go-qtools subproject. These files are separate from the main repository's agent files to keep Go-specific guidance isolated.

## Structure

- `rules/` - Coding standards and conventions specific to this Go project
- `plans/` - Implementation plans and roadmaps (if needed)

## Purpose

These agent files provide context and guidance for AI assistants working on the go-qtools codebase, separate from the main repository's bash scripts and configuration.
